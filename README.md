# USB-C Breakout board

I have searched a few places on internet and wasn't able to find a small, cheap and breadboard friendly USB-C adapter that I would like, so I made my own.
It has a neat fanout of all the USB-C pins (without the shield), which are nicely labeled for a very easy use while prototyping.
